Warcraft III Model Optimizer Script
by: Guhun
Version: 1.0.0
Compatible with Pyton 2.7 and 3.x
/////////////////////////////

Instructions:

Use the .bat files to optimizer your models. Simply drag the model file to the .bat file and it will be converted as "filename-opt.mdx/mdl"

Currently, linearizing the animations is the only optimization that will be made to the model. Use other tools for other optimizations.
